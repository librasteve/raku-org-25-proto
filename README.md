# raku-org-25-proto
a prototype upgrade to the raku.org website

currently a place for all interested folk to comment and input on [Requirements.md](https://github.com/librasteve/raku-org-25-proto/blob/main/Requirements.md)
 - open an Issue for discussion of a point
 - when agreed, make a PR for review and merge

the aim is to get all feedback within 5 days - ie by 4th June - so that it can be incorporated into the prototype build [now closed for new requirements]

all thoughts and options are open and actively encouraged - please do help make our landing page better!
